                <strong>What is HealHub?</strong><br/>
                HealHub helps to store and maintain the health records of a
                patient and provide patient’s the facility to share their
                medical records with any Medical Practitioner at their own ease.
                Medical emergencies can happen anytime and anywhere. A number of
                cases has been reported where a fraction of deaths were caused
                due to the unavailability of the patient’s health record. This
                platform removes the hassle of physical medical records and
                gives patient the power to store his medical records securely in
                one place.

                  <strong>How your data is secure with us?</strong><br/>
                  Authentication is the mechanism of associating an incoming
                  request with a set of identifying credentials, such as the
                  user the request came from, or the token that it was signed
                  with. The permission and throttling policies can then use
                  those credentials to determine if the request should be
                  permitted.
                </p>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  Knox authentication is token based, similar to the
                  TokenAuthentication built in to DRF. However, it overcomes
                  some problems present in the default implementation:
                </p>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  Knox provides one token per call to the login view - allowing
                  each client to have its own token which is deleted on the
                  server side when the client logs out.
                </p>
                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  Knox tokens are only stored in an encrypted form. Even if the
                  database were somehow stolen, an attacker would not be able to
                  log in with the stolen credentials.
